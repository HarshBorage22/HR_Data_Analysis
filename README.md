## Description 
#### This project is being implemented in order to master and get the meaningful insights from HR presence Data and visualization using [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/).

- In this report I have analysed 3 months Presence data by filtering as April, May and June 2022.
- This repository represents important Presence insights such as presence percentage,Work from percentage and sick leave percentage.
- With the help of this project we can get Different Presence percentages of employee individually.
- From this report we can see that as rainy season comes increse in seak leave % and most of the employees opted to work from home on    friday.
- Also we can visualize the data by filtering as Weekly and Monthly Basis And also in any mode such as Work from Home work from office.
- Report also shows total presence percentage on daily and weekly basis.
- WFH% indicates Work from home % and SL% indicates Seak Leave %.
- In this project I have used [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/) for visualization of data.
